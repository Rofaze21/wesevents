A crossplatform web application to make event searching easy for busy college students. The app is designed specifically centered around Wesleyan University’s 
campus and is equipped with a host of features that every event app should consist of. 

This was my first attempt to building a comprehensive product for fun and i've got to say, I've learned a great deal out of this experinece.
